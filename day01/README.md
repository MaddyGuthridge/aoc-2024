# Day 1

LibreOffice Calc implementation.

## Running

1. Open the file in LibreOffice Calc.
2. Paste your input into column A, split by lines.
3. Everything should evaluate automatically.

## Remarks

Spreadsheets are a very unpleasant way to work with data. It felt error-prone
and unreliable, which seems to be pretty normal when doing anything non-trivial
in a spreadsheet.
