# Day 3 - Typst

An implementation made using Typst. The solution is compiled into the PDF.

## Running

1. Install the Typst compiler.
2. `typst compile main.typ`
3. The answer, as well as the full working will be included in the output PDF.

## Remarks

I tried Typst early expecting it to be challenging to do real computing in, and
was pleasantly surprised! It was super easy to not just calculate the result,
but also to "show my working" on the output PDF, which was extremely nice for
debugging.
