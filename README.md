My solutions for the Advent of Code 2024.

Each day, I intend to use a different programming language.

I'll probably run out of languages at some point, but it'll be fun.

## Languages I intend to use

- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Java
- [ ] C
- [x] Rust (day 1)
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Bash + Linux Coreutils
- [ ] Typst

### Languages I intend to learn

- [ ] LibreOffice Calc
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] C#

## Day 1 - Rust

Run using `cargo run --bin day1_2 < inputs/day1`.
