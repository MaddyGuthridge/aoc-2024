# Day 13 - Nushell

A solution for day 13, written in Nushell.

## Running

`nu main.nu inputs/input.txt`

## Remarks

While Nushell doesn't offer nearly the same level of advanced functionality as
in a full-on programming language, its power as a scripting language cannot be
overstated. In particular, its string-parsing capabilities are incredible,
which made the complex input of this puzzle a breeze to handle.

After realising that the solution only required solving a simultaneous
equation, the program was incredibly simple to implement. I found Nushell to be
both a powerful and intuitive scripting language, and will definitely consider
using it as my regular terminal application.
