# Day 2 - Scratch

A horrific implementation made using Scratch. The Scratch Cat will think for a
few moments before saying the answers.

## Running

1. Install Scratch (I used version 3.30.5).
2. Open the program file.
3. Right click the "reports" table in the preview window and choose to
   "import".
4. Select your desired input file.
5. Click the green flag.

## Remarks

As expected, Scratch isn't intended for this kind of problem. I found the lack
of scoped variables, and the inability for functions to produce return values
especially frustrating. However, I can absolutely see how it makes for an
excellent introduction to programming for beginners.
