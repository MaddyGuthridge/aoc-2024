# Day 12 - Dart

A solution for day 12, written in Dart.

## Running

`dart run < inputs/input.txt`

Or you can compile an optimised build:

`dart compile exe bin/day12.dart -o bin/day12`

Then you can run with `./bin/day12 < inputs/input.txt`

## Remarks

Installing Dart on my system was a little painful -- the SDK isn't available on
platforms other than Ubuntu, so I had to do a hacky workaround by using a
symlink and the Snap package.

However, once it was installed, the experience dramatically changed for the
better, with awesome intellisense in VS Code, giving inline documentation for
basically everything. Overall, Dart feels very object-oriented, so my
familiarity with Java made it very easy to get started. I never found myself
struggling to convert my thoughts into compilable code.
