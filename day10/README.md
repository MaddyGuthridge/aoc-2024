# Day 9 - Haskell

(An attempt at) a solution to day 9 in Haskell.

## Running

Compile with `ghc Main.hs`, then run with `./Main < inputs/input.txt`

## Thoughts

Haskell's syntax is very different to what I'm used to, but after spending a
ton of time getting to grips with it (mainly by walking through
[Learn you a Haskell](https://learnyouahaskell.com/)), I came to really
appreciate how expressive and concise it is. Even with this extremely basic
level of knowledge, my code felt extremely clear (although perhaps not concise
yet), and I have no doubt that with more practice, I'll become capable of
making even nicer code!
